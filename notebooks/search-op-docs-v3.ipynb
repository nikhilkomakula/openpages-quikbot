Answer: FastMap is a productivity tool that works with the IBM OpenPages with Watson export feature, and automates the importing and batch processing of object data into OpenPages with Watson. The FastMap tool uses a data load template (a Microsoft Excel workbook in .xlsx format) to capture data for import.
