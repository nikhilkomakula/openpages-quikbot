       "'IBM OpenPages Operational Risk Management helps automate the process of measuring and monitoring operational risk. It combines all risk data, including risk and control self assessments, loss events, scenario analysis, external losses, and key risk indicators (KRI), into a single integrated solution. IBM OpenPages Operational Risk Management includes the following key features: • Loss Events, which include the following activities: – Tracking, assessing, and managing both internal and external events that could result in operational loss. • Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSA) to identify, measure, and mitigate risk. • Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which can track performance metrics to potentially show the presence or state of a risk condition or trend. • Scenario Analysis, which is an assessment technique that is used to identify and measure specific kinds of risks, in particular, low frequency, high'"

       "'A PRE trigger is called before the operation is performed by the system. For example, during the creation of a GRC Object, a PRE event has all the information about the object to be created, but the system has yet to take action to create the object and persist values. A POST trigger is called after the operation has been performed by the system and before the transaction has been committed; allowing for further processing of additional business logic. The position may affect the availability of certain information and methods within the trigger context for the rules and event handlers. Please refer to the individual event types for more detail. IBM OpenPages with Watson Trigger Developer Guide 10 of 47 Transactions All triggers on operations are executed within the same transaction of the original system operation. If an error occurs in a trigger, whether system or business logic, the framework will roll back the transaction. In other words, the original operation will be rolled back if any error occurs'"
