       "'PRE – are events that happen prior to the operation actually being performed by the system. For example, during the creation of a GRC Object, a PRE event has all the information about the object to be created, but the system has yet to take action to create the object and persist values. • POST – are events that happen after the operation has been performed by the system and before the transaction has been committed; allowing for further processing of additional business logic. The position may affect the availability of certain information and methods within the trigger context for the rules and event handlers. Please refer to the individual event types for more detail. IBM OpenPages with Watson Trigger Developer Guide 11 of 47 Transactions All triggers on operations are executed within the same transaction of the original system operation. If an error occurs in a trigger, whether system or business logic, the framework will roll back the transaction. In other words, the original operation will be '"
