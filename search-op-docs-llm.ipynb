For example, if an object type or certain object fields are included in a data load template but are excluded in a user’s profile, then that object type or those object fields will be excluded from the data imported by FastMap. You can override the default profile used by FastMap by explicitly specifying a profile in the Definition worksheet of a template. For example, if you specify the profileName parameter as OpenPages Platform 3 , Fast Map will use that profile when importing data. Chapter 28. Using FastMap 778 •Parent Object'"
